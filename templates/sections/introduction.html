          <h2>Adopt a scientific approach to eating right and staying in shape</h2>
          <p>You care about your health and yet it's not in great shape. What are you doing wrong? You've tried lots of things, but they seem to require insane levels of commitment, or sound like hocus pocus. How do you know what to believe in this confusing world?</p>
          <p>We hear you. We investigated these claims. We figured out what actually works, even if it flies in the face of common sense. But we're not endorsing any of these techniques on your behalf. Why should you believe us?</p>
          <p>Instead, come to Kilter and hear the proponents of these methods out for yourself, in the company of fellow skeptics. Find something worth trying out? Do it with a peer group for support. Find your peers at Kilter.</p>
